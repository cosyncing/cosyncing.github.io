# What this installer installs. `all` places the desktop GUI client too, runs setup, and hands the client
# a pairing; `server` stops after the broker's own files, which is what this installer did before the
# client joined the release. Both are rendered from THIS file, so the server installer is the all-in-one
# with one branch not taken rather than a second script that can drift from it.
INSTALL_MODE='all'
# One row per desktop client this release publishes: "<host> <asset> <sha256> <size>". Rows for hosts this
# script cannot resolve are inert, exactly like the Bun table's.

# `setup` shows the whole plan and asks before it changes anything, and that consent is the point of the
# command. Under `curl … | sh` this script's stdin IS the pipe, so setup would read the rest of the script
# as answers — or see EOF and decline. Reading from the terminal restores the question. A run with no
# terminal at all (CI, a container, a remote command) prints the command and stops rather than taking the
# operator's consent as given: --yes and --accept-managed-runtime-ownership are never passed here.
#
# The open is probed inside a SUBSHELL. `:` is a POSIX special built-in, and a redirection error on a
# special built-in makes the shell itself exit: dash does, with status 2 and no message, so `… || ! :
# < /dev/tty` killed this script instead of taking the branch. In a subshell that exit is contained and
# becomes an ordinary non-zero status. `2>/dev/null` wraps the subshell so the open failure is quiet on
# the one path built to stop quietly.
#
# WHICH terminal descriptor matters, and only on macOS. A reopened `/dev/tty` there delivers nothing to a
# reader that has put the terminal in raw mode — `isTTY` is true, the mode change succeeds, and no keypress
# ever arrives. setup is exactly that reader, so `setup < /dev/tty` drew its first question and could never
# be answered: a macOS operator got a wizard frozen at the language prompt, and had to interrupt it and run
# setup by hand. Reproduced from three independent pseudo-terminals (an sshd pty, `expect`, a bare
# `pty.fork`), and only on macOS; Linux takes input either way.
#
# The descriptors this script INHERITED are unaffected, and `curl … | sh` only ever replaces stdin: stdout
# and stderr still carry the operator's terminal. So setup takes its stdin from whichever of those is one,
# and `/dev/tty` stays as the last resort for the case where both were redirected — which is where it still
# works, because a shell reading a here-string is not in raw mode.
